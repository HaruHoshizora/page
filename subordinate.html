            Haru’s journey to self-discovery and learning has been anything but conventional. As a student, he struggled academically, with his highest level of education being high school in commerce. However, in early 2023, his life took a significant turn when he acquired his second computer. With the power of the internet at his fingertips, Haru began to explore the endless possibilities of what he could achieve with technology.<br><br>
            His interests spanned across coding, modifications, software development, hardware tinkering, and more. But it was when he encountered the term "data scientist" that his curiosity truly sparked. Intrigued by the potential of this field, Haru dove deep into researching what it takes to become a data scientist. He quickly realized that a strong foundation in mathematics was essential for this path. Determined, he began his journey with the basics of arithmetic and slowly built his way up. Over the course of a year, he mastered subjects like algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and linear algebra.<br><br>
            In early 2024, Haru faced a personal setback when he was sent to a rehabilitation center for the second time. Spending six months there was a costly and challenging period in his life, but it also provided him with an opportunity to reflect and grow. Upon his return, Haru resumed his studies, diving into calculus as he neared the end of his mathematical journey toward becoming a data scientist.<br><br>
            However, as Haru delved deeper into the field, he discovered that data scientists often focus more on creating dashboards and end-products, rather than engaging deeply in raw coding. This revelation led him to a turning point—he decided to shift his focus away from data science and toward something that resonated more with his passion: the Linux kernel. Haru’s love for modification, customization, and raw coding drove him to pursue this new path.<br><br>
            Yet, despite his enthusiasm and growing skills, Haru doesn’t view his current endeavors as a means to an end. He doesn’t believe he will ever land a job as a Linux kernel developer, considering the difficulty and competitiveness of the field. Instead, most of what he does now is for the pure enjoyment and challenge of it. It’s about the process, the learning, and the satisfaction of solving complex problems rather than aiming for a specific career outcome. For Haru, it's all about pursuing his passions for fun, and he embraces every new challenge as part of the journey.
